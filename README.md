Hello! Welcome to our Chrome Extension!!!

This extension is making use of DEEPAI.org's stable diffusion API.

We would like to incorporate the other API calls from their site with buttons in the future, but one step at a time! :)

Our technical difficulties: 

Trying to grab the API key from the .env in vanilla JS
(This is more of a confusing hassle that I still haven't quite figured out)

Knowing if it was actually generating a new image. 
Working on making a progress bar for our load.

Future goals for this project:

*implement a keydown event on the input field when you hit enter so you don't only have to use the button.

*Add on additional buttons for the different API's that DEEPAI has. 

*Be able to have a copy tag/script to copy the image and use where ever.

*Turn new tab into a extension button that when clicked, pops opens a modal box. 

*Another future goal would be to highlight specific text on a site and pass it into the api to generate a new image.

*Create an authentication where you can input your own personal API key to be able to use the extension
